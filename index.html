        <p>If you're looking for a show that offers both the thrill of solving crimes with a lighthearted and familial team of federal agents, NCIS might be just the show you you. Each episode centers around a different crime. The characters are relatable, fun, and balance out the darkness inherently associated with violent crime. While only for teen and adult audiences, you are less likely to be uncomfortable or triggered watching this show as you will with many others in the genre.</p>

            <p>A fan of the darker side of things? More interested in the psychological side of crime? Then try Criminal Minds, and its reboot Criminal Minds: Evolution. Dark and disturbing enough to make some of the actors leave the show, this analyzes heinous serial crimes from the perspective of a team of FBI profilers. Follow along as they create a profile for every twisted mind they encounter to catch criminals. Episodes alternate between hiding the criminal to showing what they're like while still on the loose. Despite it's gracious ratings, this will offer chilling insights into psychopathic minds.</p>
